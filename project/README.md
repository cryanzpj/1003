Author: Hao Liu,Yuhao Zhao
Project Advisor: Kurt Miller

## Introduction

In this project, we implement and evaluate several machine learning methods in the context of developing a recommender system based on [Ponpare Coupon data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/coupon-purchase-prediction). The datasets contains the user viewing log of coupons which are important in modeling personal preference. Model-wise, we look at a Collaborative Filtering algorithms, a user Clustering algorithm, a Modified Cosine Similarity method and a Conditional model, and compare their performance in terms of MAP@10 measure.
